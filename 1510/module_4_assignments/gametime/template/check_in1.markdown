### Give a Basic Description of the Game

A player moves a round blob across a screen eating small static blobs which make the player's blob bigger.  Other players move thier blobs around also eating the static blobs.  Players can eat eachother.  If you eat another player, you grow bigger.  If another player eats you, you lose and the game is over.

## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Blog moves around the screen eating small preset blobs
- Eating blobs makes the players blog grow in size
- A second blog can play at the same time and they can eat each other
- If you get eaten, you lose the game.  
- If you eat another player they lose and your blob grows bigger
- The bigger you grow, the slower you move

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?
