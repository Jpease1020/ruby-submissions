### Alon Waisman

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/MowAlon/Enigma.git

#### Notes

* Not as problematic as BST. Assignment had a more detailed description.
* 34 tests with 2 skips
* Tests document the core functionality
* Implementation is well broken down and easy to follow
* Let's talk about constants one day ... but the idea is great
* Crack is very good

#### Scores

### Matt Ewell

* GitHub URL:

#### Notes

* Didn't plan well enough, was making it too complicated
* 95 tests, about 13 broken
* Implementation has lots of neat pieces, but the stitching together is
somewhat rough -- maybe trying to do things too right the first time
* Like the direction of the testing. Make sure to run all tests from root
and run them all together frequently
* Make sure to run command-line scripts and tests from project root
